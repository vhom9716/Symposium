     1. To determine if a new trend will need to be created, if the stability check is passed consecutively a certain number of times as dictated in the trend's creation based on the relevent stock's volitability.
     2. To supply a variable, valDiff, that will determine
        -The stability wil always be decaying, making it easier for the check to be passed.
        -If rand is greater, then the check has been passed and the counter increases, but in this case, valDiff will be negative, and effect the trend consequently
